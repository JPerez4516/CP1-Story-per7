I woke up
I walked my dog Logan
I ate breakfast
I went to school
period 1
period 2
period 3
period 4
period 5
I have physics, it's probably my worst class but I have a fun time with my friends
My friends and I are always cracking jokes and messing around
Ms. Machaj is probably so tired of us
We seem to get a new worksheet everyday

I sat through some classes
I came home 
I walked Logan again
I went to sleep
