I woke up
I walked my dog Logan
I ate breakfast
I went to school
period 1
period 2
period 3
period 4
period 5
period 6
period 7
I had a awful time in PE lifting weights
I changed and went to my next 4 classes
My 5th class AP World History was a bore and I almost fell asleep
I went to my next class, chemistry, and my teeth started to fall out
I failed my test and wished I had some food
I came home and my cat had turned into a large monster
My cat, Tofu, demanded that I walked him and I did
I walked him and I tripped on a crack in the sidewalk
I jolted awake in my 5th period class
I went through the rest of my day disturbed by my dream
I came home 
I walked my cat Tofu
I went to sleep
