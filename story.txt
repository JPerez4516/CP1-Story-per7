2nd Period is my drivers ed class, my drivers ed teacher spends his time walking around making sure we
arent doing other stuff. We are currently in the simulator room and scince its summer a lot of  insects get in thee
the teacher also spends his time killing flies. I think the simulators are fun but the processing power of the computer running them is very weak. Sometimes the program lags.
